/**
 * [[MemoryManager]]强制执行和存储之间的软边界，以便任何一方都可以从另一方借用内存。
 *
 * 执行和存储之间共享的区域是（总堆空间-300MB）的一小部分，可通过`spark.memory.fraction'（默认值为0.6）进行配置。
 * 边界在该空间内的位置进一步由“ spark.memory.storageFraction”（默认值为0.5）确定。
 * 这意味着默认情况下，存储区域的大小为堆空间的0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3。
 *
 * Storage can borrow as much execution memory as is free until execution reclaims its space.
 * When this happens, cached blocks will be evicted from memory until sufficient borrowed
 * memory is released to satisfy the execution memory request.
 *
 * Similarly, execution can borrow as much storage memory as is free. However, execution
 * memory is *never* evicted by storage due to the complexities involved in implementing this.
 * The implication is that attempts to cache blocks may fail if execution has already eaten
 * up most of the storage space, in which case the new blocks will be evicted immediately
 * according to their respective storage levels.
 *
 * @param onHeapStorageRegionSize 存储区域的大小，以字节为单位。
 *                                该区域不是静态保留的。如有必要，执行可以从中借用。
 *                                仅当实际存储内存使用量超出此区域时，才可以驱逐缓存的块。
